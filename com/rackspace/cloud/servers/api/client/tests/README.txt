# WARNING...WARNING...WARNING...WARNING...WARNING...WARNING...WARNING...

# Please be aware that these tests create and destroy a LARGE number of 
# servers and, while we haven't computed the net cost of doing so, it could be 
# quite expensive.
#
# Please don't do this unless you're prepared to pay all
# associated fees including those resulting from failed tests that may leave
# servers (and your bill!) running.

#
# In order to run these unit tests, there must be a file in the
# "cloudservers/tests" directory called `account.py` which contains:
#
# RS_UN = "rackspace_username"
# RS_KEY = "rackspace_API_key"
#
# __all__ =(RS_UN, RS_KEY)
#
# Nothing in this directory can be run without a valid account.py in the 
# `tests` directory.
#
# if account.py's not there (it's not included in the distro):
#   we exit, printing out the contents of README.txt
#   then re-raise the import error, terminating the test.
# else:
#   we run the test/command line app, etc.
