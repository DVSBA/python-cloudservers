 cloud_servers_console

 A very simple text menu based application for showing the status of
everything in your Cloud Servers account.

 I developed this to make it simple to test the functionality of the library
as I went along and found it to be so handy I just left it in.

 Also, it shows real-world examples of the API in actual use which is always
my favorite type of documentation.

 It is purposely written in the most simple, straight-forward way without the
 types of optimizations or error handling that could be done in a production
 app in order to clearly show the simplest use of the API calls.

 NOTE: In order to actually run the console, you must create the file
account.py, in the tests directory, with the settings for your Cloud Servers
account.

 NOTE: Any servers created by this program are actual, live, working, billable
servers in the RackSpace Cloud.

 Always make sure to clean up what you're not using. If it's running, you're
paying for it!
