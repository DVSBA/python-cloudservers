    Full lists automatically page through the collection of items, seeming

    Lists created with specific offset and limit parameters do not page this
    way; they're limited to the records they started with.

    Please note that items are cached from the database so, if you iterate
    over the list, one of the things you iterate onto may no longer exist.

    For this reason, you must check that the item still exists before
